# FullStackApp
Full stack web application using Spring Boot and React. In this project I used Spring Boot (MVC, JPA, Hibernate) and Mysql Database to create the Backend application (Restful web service API) and I used React.js to create the frontend application with Material UI and React Hooks ( useState, useEffect ) with functional components.
